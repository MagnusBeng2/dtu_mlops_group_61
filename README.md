English-to-German Translation System
==============================

**Overall Goal of the Project**

In this project, we aim to develop an efficient and specialized English-to-German translation system by fine-tuning pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) models. The objective is to achieve high translation accuracy and optimize the model pipeline for scalability and usability. Accurate translation systems are essential for multilingual communication and are widely used in various applications, such as education, e-commerce, and international business.

**Framework to be Used**

The project will use the T5-small model, a pre-trained text-to-text transformer from the Hugging Face library. While the base model is capable of handling multilingual translation tasks, this project will fine-tune the model specifically for English-to-German translations. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to nuances in language structure and improve performance for this specific task.

The Transformer framework will play a pivotal role, providing robust tools for working with transformer-based models in Python. Additionally, PyTorch Lightning will be used to simplify the training process and manage model training efficiently.

**Data to be Used**

The primary dataset will be the WMT19 English-German translation dataset, a widely recognized dataset for machine translation tasks. This dataset includes aligned text pairs that ensure consistency and quality for training and evaluation. The dataset will be preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize text, and convert it into a format compatible with transformer models.

**Pipeline Tools and Workflow**

A structured ML pipeline will be developed using Cookiecutter for project organization, Docker for containerization, and DVC (Data Version Control) for managing data and experiments. Weights & Biases will be integrated to monitor training progress, analyze metrics, and facilitate hyperparameter tuning.

**Expected Outcome**

By fine-tuning the T5-small model and employing a robust pipeline, the aim of this project is to deliver a high-performing English-to-German translation model. The final system will be optimized for deployment and scalability, ensuring it is applicable for real-world applications.
