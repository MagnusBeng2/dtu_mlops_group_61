# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Group information

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

In this project we utilized pytorch and pytorch lightening. 

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:
The new member would have to run the commands (assuming they have git and Python 3.10 installed):
```
git clone https://github.com/MikkelGodsk/dtu_mlops_exam_project.git
cd dtu_mlops_exam_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
dvc pull
python setup.py install
```

Alternatively, you could import environment.yml:
`conda env create -n ENVNAME --file environment.yml`

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

The overall structure is initialized with the cookiecutter template. We have added a folder for conducting different tests. Since the data is handled by google drive via dvc the data folder is removed. In general we tried to as much as possible to follow the cookiecutter structure. 


### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

--- question 6 fill here ---

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement?**
>
> Answer:

In this project the code is tested on 5 different areas. The tests are conducted before merging with the main branch on github. The tests concern the dataset as well as the model. Testing the dataset consists of loading the data and checking whether the format is correct. More precicely we check if the data is given as a string and a label (en-de). When testing the model the following things must be satisfied
- The model is in torch
- The model outputs the translated sentence as a list containing a string
- In both training, validation and test the model outputs a torch tensor containing a float (not NaN)
- The weights change during training

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> **Answer length: 100-200 words.**
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we added branch protection on the main branch. Hence we created a personal branch where changes is made. We then used pull requests to merge with the main branch quite often. A pull request typically only concerned a few changes in a limited amount of scrits. Hence we avoided having an unmanageable amount of branches as well as reduced the number of merge conflicts. Before merging a branch with the main branch the tests are conducted to ensure that the merge will result in a working code. Furthermore when making major changes we assured that pull request were created and reviewed immidiatly.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

The wmt19 dataset originally contained around 9GB of data. Hence we decided to create a subset of the dataset. Data version control hereby contributed to an easy update of the data. We initially created a bucket in google cloud and used the dvc package to manage this. However we did not have enough credit to sustain this service hence we the dvc to google drive. Hereby data controll proved to be very usefull since this update on all our devices was easily made with a simple terminal commands.

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink>*
